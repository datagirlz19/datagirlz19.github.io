# Data-Science-Portfolio
This portfolio is a collection of my work completed independently and as class work to show my skills and abilities in Data Science / Analytics. 
During college, I gained experience working in team settings and creating data-driven solutions. There, I learned how to: use design visualizations for impact, create machine learning models, and teach myself skills to present actionable results to an audience. I hope you enjoy some of my insights.

# Independent Projects 

## Project 1 - Predicting Low Income Households

#### Description: 
In 2020, the US census recorded the information of over 48,000 individuals and consolidated the information into the data set provided. We were tasked with creating a model to predict whether someone has an annual income of over $50,000.

To do this, we performed basic data manipulation on the variables in the dataset to analyze the provided information and gain some insight. The dataset mostly included categorical variables, so we decided to look at each unique category. We found out that there were several overlapping variables and decided to modify them to reduce the number of categories, thus reducing potential complications.

The purpose of this project is predict whether someone has an annual income of over $50,000.

The annual census is taken to help governents provide resources to families in need. However there are many situations when this data will not be accutate or complete, such as when leadership changes the definition of what a low income family is or when families do not fill out the census with accurate/complete information. In cases like these, it is important to keep track of low income families so that the government can find ways to provide them with the necessary aid. This project aims to find house holds that are low income (making under $50,000 annually) so that proper support can be given based on speific predictors.

## Project 2 - The College of Wooster Admissions Rate
#### Description: 

The purpose of this project is to determine who is more likely to apply to Wooster, and how we can increase these results.

The College of Wooster is a small liberal arts school in Ohio that mainly attracts students due to its prestigious Independent Study Program that draws in students from around the globe. Despite the college's appeal, the college struggles to obtain domestic students, as only 55% of the students that apply to the school are admitted, and only 16% of the students that are admitted to the school accept the offer.We were allowed to condut an analysis on a dataset of over 2,000 students in hopes of finding insights into the data and providing small solutions to increase the number of student acceptances.
