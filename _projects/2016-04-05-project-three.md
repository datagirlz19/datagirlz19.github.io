Twitter can be a powerful tool, both as a resource for finding urgent information about situations around the globe and a tool for communicating useless information about sales and petty gossip. Hashtags are useful tools for shifting through the clutter, however, oftentimes they are misused, such as putting disaster terms like "#Hurricane" on a sale ad to increase views. This has made it difficult for professionals to identify important and relevant information in accordance with their needs. However, in the past decade, humans have become able to teach computers to examine the complex structure of the English language as the field of machine learning advances. This has become increasingly salient, as humans can no longer review  content created by social media because it is complex. The purpose of the research paper is to use a machine learning technique called  Natural Language Processing (NLP) to read through the tweets and  predict which tweets on Twitter are about natural disasters and which ones arenâ€™t. Using a collection of Twitter disaster tweets, that calls for Natural Language Processing techniques, and pairing them with a Random Forest and Multinomial Naive Bayes Regressions, an accuracy of 80.6 percent was obtained. The findings are promising, and they could help the general population sort through and analyze information shared during times of mass crisis. 

The purpose of this project is to use NLP to predict whether a tweet is reporting on a natural disaster/crisis or not.
